s3 bucket -- to store terraform lock file remotely instead of local
DynamoDB  -- for locking the state file

VPC
CIDR - VPC has a number i.e.r CIDR
CIDR --> Classless inter domain routing
Subnet
Public subnet -- will have route to the Internet gateway
Internet Gateway igw --> to provide internet connection to VPC
Private Subnet -- will NOT have route to the Internet gateway
NAT Gateway  -- to provide internet access to servers in private subnet
Elastic IP(static IP0 -- required for NAT Gateway creation

IGW - if traffic coming internet to server --> ingress
NAT - if server is sending traffic to internet --> egress



VPC and subnets Creation
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
create VPC with CIDR 10.0.0.0/16
Create IGW(Internet gateway) and attach to VPC

Create 2 public subnets in 2 regions i.e., 1a and 1b
Create 2 private subnets in 2 regions
Create 2 Database(private) subnets in 2 regions 
Note: Private and Databse are private subnets only

Create route table for public subnets with vpc and add public subnets
Create route table for private subnets with vpc and add private subnets
Create route table for Database subnets with vpc and add database subnets

Edit public route table and add routes with 0.0.0.0/0 with Internet Gateway --- then only it will become public subnet
public subnet will have route to the Internet gateway
Private subnet will not have route to the Internet gateway

Create Elastic IP(Static IP) for NAT Gateway
Create NAT Gateway with Public Subnet and Elastic IP

Edit private(Database) route table and add routes with 0.0.0.0/0 with NAT Gateway --- then only it will become private subnet

subnets will automatically have access between them

VPC --> 10.0.0.0/16
IGW --> Attach to VPC
Public subnets --> 10.0.1.0/24 10.0.2.0/24
Public Subnets --> Public Route --> 0.0.0.0/0 --> IGW

Private Subnets --> 10.0.11.0/24 10.0.12.0/24
Private Subnets --> Private Route --> 0.0.0.0/0 --> NAT

Database Subnets --> 10.0.21.0/24 10.0.22.0/24
Database Subnets --> Database Route --> 0.0.0.0/0 --> NAT

NAT --> if you want to enable egress internet to the servers in private subnet, you should create NAT gateway in public subnet and provide route to private subnets
if traffic coming to server --> ingress
if server is sending traffic to internet --> egress
