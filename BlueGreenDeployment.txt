Blue Green Deployment steps:
----------------------------
Create infra using 27-terraform-aws-eks repo
27-terraform-aws-eks
---------------------
00-vpc
10-sg
20-bastion
40-eks
30-rds
Create 3 images with 29-expense-docker repo same as 18-expense-docker --> 02-backend
setup Database from Bastion
git clone https://github.com/DAWS-2025-82S/28-k8-blue-green.git
cd 28-k8-blue-green
cd backend


 kubectl create namespace expense
 kubectl apply -f config-map.yaml

 For version 1.0.0 change image in blue-deployment.yaml to backendbluegreen:1.0.0
 kubectl apply -f blue-deployment.yaml

 kubectl apply -f main-service.yaml

Test from debug pod
curl http://backend:8080/health

output shows blue 1.0.0

For green deployment 2.0.0 change image in green-deployment.yaml to backendbluegreen:2.0.0
kubectl apply -f green-deployment.yaml

Next to test green before changing the network to green create preview service with version: green

kubectl apply -f preview-service.yaml

Test from debug pod
curl http://backend-preview:8080/health

output shows green 2.0.0

if green works fine switch the route(network) to green
for that in k9s edit  main service and update with version: green under selector to route
traffic to green i.e., version 2.0.0

Test after switching the traffic to green
curl http://backend:8080/health

output shows green 2.0.0

to test version 3.0.0
Next change image in blue-deployment.yaml to backendbluegreen:3.0.0

kubectl apply -f blue-deployment.yaml

 Update with version: blue in preview-service.yaml

 kubectl apply -f preview-service.yaml

Test from debug pod
curl http://backend-preview:8080/health

output shows blue 3.0.0

if blue 3.0.0 works fine switch the route(network) to blue
for that in k9s edit  main service and update with version: blue under selector to route
traffic to blue i.e., version 3.0.0

Test from debug pod
curl http://backend:8080/health

output shows blue 3.0.0

suppose if any issue occurs in blue 3.0.0 to revert back to previuos version
In k9s edit  main service and update with version: green under selector to go back to previous version

Test from debug pod
curl http://backend:8080/health

output shows green 2.0.0
